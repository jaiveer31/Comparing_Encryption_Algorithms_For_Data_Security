# Comparing_Encryption_Algorithms_For_Data_Security
In this project, different encryption algorithms, namely Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm (AES), Data Encryption Standard Algorithm (DES), Triple Data Encryption Standard Algorithm (3DES) and Blowfish Algorithm, are simulated in Python. A comparative analysis is done on these algorithms.
